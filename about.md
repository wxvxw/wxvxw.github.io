##Summary
Hi, I am Fang Liang Lee. A C++/C# programmer with strong foundations in game development based in Singapore. My work experiences include working on AAA titles on the Assassin's Creed brand as well as indie titles developed with XNA for the Xbox 360. My main interests are in the design, development & optimization of systems and new technology for games on the PC, console & mobile platforms. As a secondary interest and to satisfy my curiosity, I am also into web/mobile app development using NodeJS, AngularJS and ionic.

By the way, I love scotch whisky, beers, electronic music and games, in no particular order.
